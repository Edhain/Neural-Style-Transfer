Neural style transfer combines the content of one image with the style of another using a pretrained convolutional neural network. By extracting content and style features, and defining loss functions to measure their differences, the network optimizes the generated image to minimize content and style losses. Through an iterative optimization process, the pixel values are adjusted to create a new image that preserves the content of the input image while adopting the artistic style of the reference image. Fine-tuning and post-processing steps further enhance the stylized output

Neural style transfer can be used to make image filters much more versatile as it is possible to change the style of an image, it can be done by simply providing the CNN model with the image whose style you want to be transferred to your image.
